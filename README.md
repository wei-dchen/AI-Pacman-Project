University of Washington CSE 573 Artificial Intelligence I - Winter 2020

The Pac-Man projects were adopted from UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence class, CS 188. Various classic Artificial Intelligence concepts, such as Searching, Heuristics, Adversarial Behaviour, Reinforcement Learning, Probablistic Inference etc. are separated into four folders as summarized below: 

Searching - DFS, BFS, UCS, Greedy Search, A* Search

MultiAgent - minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax

reinforcement - Markov Decision Processes, reinforcement learning, Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, Q-learning, Approximate Q-learning

ghostbusters - Hidden Markov Model, Bayes Net, Particle Filtering.
